# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in this project!  
This repository is primarily a personal learning project focused on data exploration and analysis.  
The goal is to share my work openly — contributions are welcome, but please keep the following in mind:

  Contributions that help improve clarity, fix minor issues, or enhance learning value are welcome.

  I'm not actively maintaining a roadmap or feature backlog for this project.  
  Significant feature additions may not be accepted.

- **Discussion & Suggestions**:  
  Feel free to open issues for discussion, feedback, or suggestions.

- **Code of Conduct**:  
  Please be respectful and constructive.
